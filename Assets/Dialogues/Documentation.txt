// A Dialogue File is groups of lines split by solo newline character
// Groups of single lines are Dialogue Lines
// Groups with multiple lines are Dialogue-Choices:
//    A Dialogue Line followed by a list of Choices

// Each Dialogue Line has this structure:
//
// [LINE_LABEL] "SPEAKER": "CONTENT" <FLAGS, TO, MODIFY> [NEXT_LINE_1]:<FLAGS, FOR, SELECTION, ...> [NEXT_LINE_2]:<FLAGS, ...> ... [NEXT_LINE_DEFAULT]
//

// Each Dialogue-Choice has this structure:
//
// [LINE_LABEL] "SPEAKER": "CONTENT" <FLAGS, TO, MODIFY> 
// "CHOICE_PROMPT_1" <FLAGS, TO, MODIFY> [NEXT_LINE_A1]:<FLAGS, FOR, SELECTION, ...> ... [NEXT_LINE_DEFAULT_A]
// "CHOICE_PROMPT_2" <FLAGS, TO, MODIFY> [NEXT_LINE_B1]:<FLAGS, ...> ... [NEXT_LINE_DEFAULT_B]
// ...
//

// Special Requirements:
// 
// All strings (words) are case sensitive
//
// All [LINE_LABELS] can be any combination of letters and spaces except for Special [LINE_LABELS] listed below.
// They must be wrapped in square brackets []
//
// All FLAGS must be one string (of characters, i.e. a word) without spaces or commas
// Lists of flags are separated via commas ,
// Each list of flags (even lists of one) must be wrapped in angle brackets <>
//
// All standalone Dialogue Lines and Dialogue Choices must end with at least a default [NEXT_LINE]
//

// Special [LINE_LABELS]:
//
// []
// An empty line label signals the end of the dialogue when used as a [NEXT_LINE]
// A line labeled as [] will be ignored.
//
// [REPEAT] 
// A line labeled as [REPEAT] will be used as the entry line for when the player has already spoken with the dialogue agent.
// There should only be one of these lines, so any line labeld as [REPEAT] after the first one in the dialogue will be ignored.
//

// Special Conditions:
//
// Conditional Dialogue Paths
// A [LINE] followed immediately by a colon : and a list of <FLAGS> is a conditional dialogue path that the dialogue
// will take if the flags are present
//
// Logic Lines
// A line with no speaker and no dialogue line goes directly into the next line logic
// This can be used to control which dialogue path to take on the first dialogue line, for instance
//
// Random Line Selection
// A line with multiple default next lines will randomly choose from them.
